# Hello, I’m @just-devBot  

A programmer on a journey to become a Full Stack Web Developer.  
On this account, I’ll be sharing my daily progress, the technologies I’m learning, and everything I document along the way.

## About Me  
I’m a Computer Science student with 1.5 years of experience (from 3/6/2025).  
During this time, I worked on several projects, ranging from simple to medium-level complexity.  

I prefer self-learning because it gives me the freedom to choose what I learn and when.  
Most of my time is spent learning and applying what I learn.  
My main learning sources are YouTube, official documentation, and free online resources.  

> Note: English is not my first language, but my current level allows me to understand and communicate, and I’m working hard to improve it every day.

## My Learning Path in Programming  

- Started by learning what a computer is, its components, functions, and properties.
- Learned Binary, Hexadecimal, and Octal number systems, and how computers perform calculations.
- Learned the basics of Networking and Algorithms.
- Practiced algorithms using Flowcharts to understand logic visually.
- Applied these algorithms using C++, solving 200 to 300 algorithms, and building small to medium projects using Procedural Programming.

- After that, I started learning how to build interactive Terminal Applications, where the user can directly interact with the program.
- Then I moved to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), applied its concepts in more complex projects, and focused on writing Clean Code.
- Learned Data Structures, practiced solving problems related to them, and expanded into Databases, practicing SQL Queries on platforms like W3Schools and LeetCode.
- After that, I learned C# and built Windows Forms Applications, applying Three-Tier Architecture.

- I then entered the web development world, starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Learned PHP and built Full Stack applications.
- Later, I learned Django, building projects that consume and interact with RESTful APIs.

- Currently, I’m diving deeper into Django REST Framework to enhance my backend skills.
  


> This is my self-learning path. At university, I also studied additional programming languages, which you will find included in the technologies I listed.
